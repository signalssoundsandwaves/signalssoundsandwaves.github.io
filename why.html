                    <h1>Why Signals Sounds and Waves?</h1>
                    <h4>Sounds</h4>
                    <p>
                        We all know what sound is, you cant avoid it. In fact, there is a whole industry devoted to
                        trying to do
                        just that - sound isolation can be expensive and it's actually really hard to do.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        An important thing I'd like to point out is that sound is a physical occurrence which happens in
                        the real
                        world: something has to move to create sound waves. The speakers on your computer can make sound
                        waves, but
                        sound
                        waves can not be made by software or with any amount of fancy coding.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong><cite>So what makes sound?</cite></strong>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Vibrations.. When an object vibrates, energy is passed on to air particles surrounding the
                        object making
                        them vibrate; in turn they vibrate, bumping into neighboring particles, causing a domino effect
                        until
                        particles are vibrating at our ear drums. Notice in the animation that although there is the
                        illusion of
                        continual forward motion; the red dots in the animation show how the particles always remain
                        relative to
                        their stationary position. There are moments when the particles are densely populated
                        <cite>(compression)</cite> and
                        moments when they are sparsely populated <cite>(rarefaction)</cite>. Here's a link to a site
                        which explains
                        it more
                        thoroughly - i particularly like the earthworm analogy.

                    <h4>Waves</h4>
                    <p>
                        Something I found really interesting in the last link was the claim that the usual graphed
                        representation of
                        a sound wave isn't how sound works at all.. That's why I liked the earthworm in it so much, and
                        why I think
                        it is important to make a distinction between the terms. The earthworm moves in a similar motion
                        to a
                        <cite>'real'</cite>
                        sound wave - movement through 'compression' and 'rarefaction'. This is called a
                        <cite>longitudinal
                            wave</cite> , as its
                        vibrations occur along one axis.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's not that easy to graph a longitudinal wave without it looking more like the motion of a
                        <cite>transverse wave</cite>
                        , which is where the confusion lies. An example of a transverse wave would be the movement of a
                        guitar
                        string - the vibrations in a guitar string moving up and down whilst played are at right angles
                        to the
                        direction the sound wave travels. Without getting you too dizzy, here's are some more gifs, one
                        comparing
                        the movement of a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave and one which I think best depicts the
                        relationship between a longitudinal wave and a graphed waveform.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Luckily both these waves share the same characteristics; the two most important are shown in the
                        previous animation, the <cite>wavelength</cite> and the <cite>amplitude</cite>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The wavelength</strong> is a measurement of a single cycle, in the above representation
                        that's the
                        distance
                        between one peak to the next expressed in meters. A similar measurement is the cycle period
                        which is the
                        time taken for a cycle to complete measured in seconds.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The amplitude</strong> is a measurement taken from the baseline to the maximum extent of
                        the wave,
                        it's
                        a
                        measurement of the sound pressure level (SPL) and more commonly converted to dB's
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The definition of a 'Signal' on wikipedia is:

                    <p>
                        For the most part if we are trying to <cite>"convey information about a phenomena"</cite>, the
                        set X will be
                        discrete measurements of time and Y can be any
                        secondary data we might have. Mathematically the previous animation is a graphed sine function,
                        in this case
                        the X coordinate denotes time and the Y
                        coordinate amplitude.


                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <cite>Analog</cite> signals are continuous in time and amplitude, whereas <cite>Digital</cite>
                        signals are a
                        discrete set of amplitudes in time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Any real sound made by the process of <cite>compression and rarefaction</cite> can be converted
                        to electric
                        signals and back again using
                        <cite>transducers, (microphones and speakers)</cite>, both examples of analog signals. Likewise
                        these
                        electric signals can be converted to
                        digital signals using an <cite>Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)</cite> and back again with a
                        <cite>Digital
                            to Analog Converter (DAC)</cite>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Without getting in too deep, the process of the ADC involves two main concepts,
                        <cite>Sampling</cite> and
                        <cite>Quantisation</cite>.
                        This can be best described using a series of figures, so we come back to the humble sine wave.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Figure 1 depicts an analog signal, a sine wave with continuous time on x axis and continuous
                        amplitude on
                        the y axis. In order for a digital system to represent that signal the ADC
                        must take measurements of the amplitude at regular intervals, this is dictated by the
                        <cite>sample
                            rate</cite>; the more samples that are taken the better the representation of the input
                        signal will be.
                        Figure 2 depicts that same signal being sampled with a samplerate of 48k, that's 48000 samples
                        per second.
                        Just as the digital system forces us to take these measurements at discrete intervals in time,
                        the system
                        also forces us to measure the amplitude in discrete steps, this is called
                        <cite>quantisation</cite> and it
                        is dictated by the <cite>bit rate</cite>. A dipiction of this process is shown in figure 3.
