        <h4>Sounds</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
            We all know what sound is, you cant avoid it. In fact, there is a whole industry devoted to trying to do
            just that - sound isolation can be expensive and it's actually really hard to do.
            <br />
            <br />
            An important thing I'd like to point out is that sound is a physical occurrence which happens in the real
            world: something has to move to create sound waves. The speakers on your computer can make sound waves, but
            sound
            waves can not be made by software or with any amount of fancy coding.
            <br />
            <br />
            So what makes sound?
            <br />
            <br />
            Vibrations.. When an object vibrates, energy is passed on to air particles surrounding the object making
            them vibrate; in turn they vibrate, bumping into neighboring particles, causing a domino effect until
            particles are vibrating at our ear drums. Notice in the animation that although there is the illusion of
            continual forward motion; the red dots in the animation show how the particles always remain relative to
            their stationary position. There are moments when the particles are densely populated (compression) and
            moments when they are sparsely populated (rarefaction). Here's a link to a site which explains it more
            thoroughly - i particularly like the earthworm analogy.

        <h4>Waves</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Something I found really interesting in the last link was the claim that the usual graphed representation of
            a sound wave isn't how sound works at all.. That's why I liked the earthworm in it so much, and why I think
            it is important to make a distinction between the terms. The earthworm moves in a similar motion to a 'real'
            sound wave - movement through 'compression' and 'rarefaction'. This is called a longitudinal wave, as its
            vibrations occur along one axis.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's not that easy to graph a longitudinal wave without it looking more like the motion of a transverse
            wave, which is where the confusion lies. An example of a transverse wave would be the movement of a guitar
            string - the vibrations in a guitar string moving up and down whilst played are at right angles to the
            direction the sound wave travels. Without getting you too dizzy, here's are some more gifs, one comparing
            the movement of a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave and one which I think best depicts the
            relationship between a longitudinal wave and a graphed waveform.

            Luckily both these waves share the same characteristics; the two most important are shown in the
            previous animation, the wavelength and the amplitude.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The wavelength</strong> is a measurement of a single cycle, in the above representation that's the
            distance
            between one peak to the next expressed in meters. A similar measurement is the cycle period which is the
            time taken for a cycle to complete measured in seconds.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The amplitude</strong> is a measurement taken from the baseline to the maximum extent of the wave,
            it's
            a
            measurement of the sound pressure level (SPL) and more commonly converted to dB's
            <br>

        <h4>Signals</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>
        The definition of a <cite>'Signal'</cite> on wikipedia is <blockquote>"..a function that conveys information about a phenomenon"</blockquote>
        <cite>So what's a function?</cite> Wiki defines a function as <blockquote>"..a process that associates to each element of a set X a single element of a set Y"</blockquote>
        For the most part if we are trying to <cite>"convey information about a phenomena"</cite>, the set X will be discrete measurements of time and Y can be any 
        secondary data we might have. Mathematically the previous animation is a graphed sine function, in this case the X coordinate denotes time and the Y 
        coordinate amplitude.  
        <br>
        <br>
        In analog audio sound waves are converted to electronic signals and back again using <strong>transducers</strong>, <cite>microphones and speakers</cite>. Likewise These electronic signals 
        can then be converted to digital signals using an <strong>Analog to Digital Converter</strong>, <cite>(ADC)</cite> and back again with a <strong>Digital to Analog Converter</strong>, 
        <cite>DAC</cite>.
