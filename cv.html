    PERSONAL PROFILE:
    Last year I graduated from Birmingham City University with a 1st Class BSc(hons) in Sound Engineering and
    Production. My final year project involved Digital Signal Processing and audio software development. Since
    graduating, I have studied some software development, organised live music events, and worked as a gardener. At the
    height of the pandemic I was unable to work as my wife’s elderly Grandmother was living with us, I am now looking
    for an entry level role within the audio sector.
